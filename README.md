This project is a Machine Learning application designed to classify news articles as either "Real" or "Fake" based on their textual content.
By analysing thousands of news articles, the model learns distinguishing patterns and vocabulary used in misinformation.

🚀 Key Features:

High Accuracy: Achieved 99% accuracy using the Logistic Regression algorithm.

Data Processing: Implemented advanced text cleaning and TF-IDF Vectorization to process raw text data.

Visualization: Includes Confusion Matrix heatmaps and Word Clouds to visualize frequent words in fake vs. real news.

Tech Stack: Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
